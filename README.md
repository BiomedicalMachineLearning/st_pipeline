**Spatial Transcriptomics Pipeline**

ST Pipeline contains the tools and scripts needed to process and analyze the raw files generated with the Spatial Transcriptomics method in FASTQ format. 

The following files are required :
- FASTQ files (Read 1 containing the spatial information and the UMI and read 2 containing the real sequence) 
- A genome index generated with STAR 
- An annotation file in GTF or GFF format
- The file containing the barcodes and array coordinates (look at the folder "ids" and chose the correct one. 
- A name for the dataset

The ST pipeline has multiple parameters mostly related to trimming, mapping and annotation but generally the default values are enough. You can see a full description of the parameters typing "st_pipeline_run.py --help" after you have installed the ST pipeline.

Basically what the ST pipeline does is :
- Quality trimming (read 1 and read 2) :
	- Remove low quality bases
	- Sanity check
	- Check quality UMI
	- Remove artiacts (PolyT, PolyA, PolyG and PolyC)
	- Check for AT content
	- Discard reads with a minimum number of bases
- Mapping with STAR (only read 2)
- Demultiplexing with taggd (only read 1)
- Keep reads (read 2) that contain a valid barcode and are correctly mapped. 
- Annotate the reads with htseq-count
- Group annotated reads by barcode(spot position) and gene to get a read count
- In the grouping/counting only unique molecules (UMIs) are kept. 

You can see a graphical more detailed description of the workflow in the documents workflow.pdf and workflow_extended.pdf

The output will be a JSON file containing
the aggregated transcripts (coordinates,gene, count) and a BED file containing the transcripts (Read name, coordinate, gene, etc..)
The ST pipeline will also output a log file and a stats file with useful information.

**Installation**

We recommend you install a virtual environment like Pyenv or Anaconda before you install the pipeline. 

First clone the repository or download a tar/zip from the releases section. 
Access the cloned repository folder or the folder where the tar/zip file has been decompressed. 

To install the pipeline type then

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

To run a test type

    python setup.py test

To see the different options type 

    st_pipeline_run.py --help
