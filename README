ST Pipeline contains the tools and scripts needed to process and analyze the sequenced
reads files generated in the Spatial Transcriptomics group in FASTQ format. 

The required input files are two fastq files, a genome reference, an annotation reference and the file
containing the IDs (from the array-chip-plate) in case the reads need
to be spatially demultiplexed, plus the optional configuration parameters. 

The output will be two JSON files and a BED file, one containing
the features (id,cordinates,gene) and another one containing the raw reads and the id.
